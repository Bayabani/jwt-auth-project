Project: Implementing Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) in a NestJS Application
Project Overview
The goal of this project is to implement a robust role-based access control (RBAC) system in a NestJS application. This system will include full authentication and authorization flows, ensuring that only authorized users can access certain resources based on their roles.
Objectives
User Authentication: Implement user authentication using JWT (JSON Web Token) to manage user sessions securely.
Role-Based Authorization: Create an authorization system that assigns roles to users and restricts access to certain routes based on these roles.
Password Management: Ensure secure storage and management of user passwords using bcrypt for hashing.
User Registration and Login: Provide endpoints for user registration and login.
Protected Routes: Create routes that are protected by the authentication and authorization system, ensuring only users with the appropriate roles can access them.
Requirements
1. User Authentication
JWT Authentication: Use JWT for handling authentication tokens. The tokens should be signed with a secret key and should have an expiration time.
Passport.js: Integrate Passport.js with NestJS to manage authentication strategies.
2. Role-Based Authorization
Roles Definition: Define roles such as admin, user, and potentially more based on application needs.
Role Assignment: Allow roles to be assigned to users upon registration or through an admin interface.
Access Control: Implement a mechanism to restrict access to certain routes based on user roles. Use custom decorators and guards to enforce these restrictions.
3. Secure Password Management
Password Hashing: Use bcrypt to hash passwords before storing them in the database.
Password Validation: Ensure that password validation checks the hashed password against the stored hash.
4. User Registration and Login
Registration Endpoint: Create an endpoint to register new users. This should include validation for required fields (e.g., username, password) and ensure that usernames are unique.
Login Endpoint: Create an endpoint to log in users. This should return a JWT token upon successful authentication.
5. Protected Routes
JWT Guard: Implement a guard to protect routes using JWT. Only authenticated users should be able to access these routes.
Role Guard: Implement a guard to restrict access to routes based on user roles.
Detailed Implementation Steps
Step 1: Project Setup
Set up a new NestJS project.
Install necessary dependencies for JWT, Passport.js, bcrypt, and TypeORM.
Step 2: Create User Entity
Define a User entity with fields such as id, username, password, and roles.
Configure TypeORM to manage the User entity.
Step 3: Authentication Module
Create an authentication module, service, and controller.
Implement user registration and login functionalities in the authentication service.
Generate JWT tokens on successful login.
Step 4: JWT Strategy
Implement a JWT strategy using Passport.js.
Configure Passport.js to validate JWT tokens and extract user information.
Step 5: Role-Based Authorization
Create a custom decorator to define roles for routes.
Implement a role guard that uses the custom decorator to restrict access based on user roles.
Step 6: Secure Password Management
Use bcrypt to hash user passwords before saving them to the database.
Validate passwords by comparing the hashed password with the stored hash during login.
Step 7: Protect Routes
Apply the JWT guard to routes that need to be protected.
Apply the role guard to routes that need role-based access control.
Step 8: Testing
Test the user registration and login endpoints to ensure JWT tokens are issued correctly.
Test protected routes to ensure they are accessible only to authenticated users.
Test role-based access control to ensure routes are accessible only to users with the appropriate roles.
Deliverables
